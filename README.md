How to use the files?

As the filename suggests, EDA_results.xlsx is about EDA using pivot tables / charts / formula.
It contains summary of insights and explaination of the logic behind feature creation (part d
in hmc.ipynb).

hmc.ipynb has all the codes for the whole assessment, from data exploration to price elasticity
aggregation to machine learning model building. Please be reminded to change the directory to 
the location of the dataset file (ds_assessment_dataset_2024.csv) before execution.
